                    <h2>Our origin</h2>
                    <p>Virexon didn't begin in a boardroom, but in a laboratory. Founded in the late 80s by the visionary Dr. Aris Thorne, our company emerged from a singular, defiance-fueled question: "Why must biological decay be inevitable?" What started as a small pharmaceutical venture quickly pivoted when we discovered anomalous compounds in remote, untouched ecosystems. We realized that nature hides the keys to immortality; it just needed a firm hand to unlock them.</p>

                    <h2>Our mission</h2>
                    <p>Our mission is not merely to sustain life, but to enhance it. We believe that the human genome is a draft, not a final manuscript. Through our controversial yet groundbreaking "Helix-4" initiatives, we strive to offer our elite clientele a life free from the constraints of aging and disease. At Virexon, we do not wait for evolution to take its course—we seize the reins and steer humanity toward a stronger, more resilient dawn.</p>

                    <p>Tomorrow is a resource to be harvested. As we expand our operations to exclusive, off-grid research archipelagos, we are on the verge of the next great leap. Our predictive models suggest a world where death is an option, not a certainty. We are currently developing self-sustaining habitats and bio-synthetic augmentation that will redefine what it means to be human. Join us, and leave mortality behind.</p>
